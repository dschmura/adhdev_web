    <p class="mb-4 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-normal">Deploying Jumpstart Pro is easy. We've even configured a staging environment for you.</p>

<p class="mb-4">You'll need a Redis and PostgreSQL database setup to deploy Jumpstart Pro.</p>

    <h2 class="pb-3 mb-6 border-b border-gray-400">Environments</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Jumpstart Pro is preconfigured with two environments for deploying: staging and production.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Background workers will be configured to run in all environments so you will have the same experience in development as you will in staging and production.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Email providers will only be configured for production by Jumpstart Pro, so you don't accidentally send emails to real users in staging.</p>

    <h2 class="pb-3 mb-6 border-b border-gray-400">Credentials</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">You will need to take the contents of <code>config/credentials/staging.key</code> or <code>config/credentials/production.key</code> (depending on what env you're deploying) and set the <code>RAILS_MASTER_KEY</code> environment variable to the contents of this file. This will allow staging or production to decrypt your credentials for the correct environment.</code> </p>

    <h2 class="pb-3 mb-6 border-b border-gray-400">Hatchbox</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Hatchbox.io is built by the makers of Jumpstart Pro and GoRails. It's a fantastically simple and cheap option for deploying apps to your own servers.</p>

    <h2 class="pb-3 mb-6 border-b border-gray-400">Heroku</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Deploying to Heroku is easy. You'll need to setup Redis and PostgreSQL addons to run your app.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">We also include a Procfile to help automatically configure your Heroku processes.</p>

    <h2 class="pb-3 mb-6 border-b border-gray-400">Docker</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">We provide a sample Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for you in case you'd like to deploy your application using Docker.</p>
